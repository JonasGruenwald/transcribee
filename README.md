# Transcribee Fork

This is a fork of https://github.com/bugbakery/transcribee.

I made it because I'd like to use the software locally, and the docker setup on main is broken: https://github.com/bugbakery/transcribee/issues/427

In this fork, I've made some slightly hacky changes that allow me to run the software with docker compose.

## Run with compose 

```sh
docker compose up
```
